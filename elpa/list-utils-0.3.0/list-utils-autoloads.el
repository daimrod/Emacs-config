Return non-nil if CELL holds a cons cell rather than a proper list.

A proper list is defined as a series of cons cells in which the
cdr slot of each cons holds a pointer to the next element of the
list, and the cdr slot in the final cons holds nil.

A plain cons cell, for the purpose of this function, is a single
cons in which the cdr holds data rather than a pointer to the
next cons cell, eg

    '(1 . 2)

In addition, a list which is not nil-terminated is not a proper
list and will be recognized by this function as a cons cell.
Such a list is printed using dot notation for the last two
elements, eg

    '(1 2 3 4 . 5)

Such improper lists are produced by `list*'.

Find the depth of LIST, which may contain other lists.
