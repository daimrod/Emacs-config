Load current buffer into Prolog or post query (Do What I Mean).
If invoked on a line starting with `:-' or `?-', possibly
preceded by `%' and whitespace, call `ediprolog-interact' with
the query as argument. Otherwise, call `ediprolog-consult'.

With prefix argument 0, kill the Prolog process. With prefix 1,
equivalent to `ediprolog-consult'. With prefix 2, equivalent to
`ediprolog-consult' with a new Prolog process. With prefix 7,
equivalent to `ediprolog-toplevel'. With just C-u, first call
`ediprolog-consult' and then, if point is on a query, call
`ediprolog-interact' with it as argument. Analogously, C-u C-u
for `ediprolog-consult' with a new process. With other prefix
arguments, equivalent to `ediprolog-remove-interactions'.
