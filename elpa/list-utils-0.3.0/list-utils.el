;;
;; Explanation
;;
;; List-utils is a collection of functions for list manipulation.
;; This library has no user-level interface; it is only useful
;; for programming in Emacs Lisp.
;;
;; Notable functionality includes
;;
;;     * `list-utils-flatten', a robust list-flattener which handles
;;       cyclic lists, non-nil-terminated lists, and preserves nils
;;       when they are found as list elements.
;;
;;     * `tconc', a simple data structure for efficiently appending
;;       to a list
;;
;; The following functions are provided:
;;
;;     `make-tconc'
;;     `tconc-p'
;;     `tconc-list'
;;     `tconc'
;;     `list-utils-cons-cell-p'
;;     `list-utils-cyclic-length'
;;     `list-utils-improper-p'
;;     `list-utils-make-proper-copy'
;;     `list-utils-make-proper-inplace'
;;     `list-utils-make-improper-copy'
;;     `list-utils-make-improper-inplace'
;;     `list-utils-linear-p'
;;     `list-utils-linear-subseq'
;;     `list-utils-cyclic-p'
;;     `list-utils-cyclic-subseq'
;;     `list-utils-make-linear-copy'
;;     `list-utils-make-linear-inplace'
;;     `list-utils-safe-length'
;;     `list-utils-safe-equal'
;;     `list-utils-depth'
;;     `list-utils-flatten'
;;     `list-utils-alist-flatten'
;;     `list-utils-insert-before'
;;     `list-utils-insert-after'
;;     `list-utils-insert-before-pos'
;;     `list-utils-insert-after-pos'
;;     `list-utils-plist-reverse'
;;     `list-utils-plist-del'
;;
;; To use list-utils, place the list-utils.el library somewhere
;; Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;     (require 'list-utils)
;;
;; Notes
;;
;;     This library includes an implementation of the classic LISP
;;     `tconc' which is outside the "list-utils-" namespace.
;;
;; Compatibility and Requirements
;;
;;     GNU Emacs version 24.3-devel     : yes, at the time of writing
;;     GNU Emacs version 24.1 & 24.2    : yes
;;     GNU Emacs version 23.3           : yes
;;     GNU Emacs version 22.3           : yes
;;     GNU Emacs version 21.x and lower : unknown
;;
;;     No external dependencies
;;
;; Bugs
;;
;; TODO
;;
;;     test cyclic inputs to all
;;     test improper inputs to all
;;     test single-element lists as inputs to all
;;     test cyclic single-element lists as inputs to all
;;
;;     should list-utils-make-improper-inplace accept nil as a special case?
;;
;;     could do -copy/-inplace variants for more functions, consider doing
;;     so for flatten
;;
;;     list* returns a non-list on single elt, our function throws an error
